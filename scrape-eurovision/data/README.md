This folder contains datasets of eurovision participants. There are 4 distinct datasets:

1. `eurovision_songs_official.csv`: data downloaded from the official [Eurovision Song Contest website](https://eurovision.tv/). Schema is `artist,country,title,place_final,points_final,year`. The number of rows is 1645. The `place_final` and `points_final` columns contain respectively the position and points that a certain song has achieved during the Eurovision final of that year. If a song was rejected before the final, these columns would contain null values.
2. `eurovision_songs_esc.csv`: data downloaded from [esc history website](https://www.esc-history.com/). This dataset also contains the language of each song. Schema is `artist,country,language,title,year`. The number of rows is 1354.
3. `eurovision_songs_merged.csv`: obtained by merging the previous two datasets, keeping all rows from the official one and merging the `language` column of the second into the first. This fills 1039 rows with a language, leaving 606 songs without an assigned language.
4. `eurovision_songs_final.csv`: the dataset obtained in step 3 is then manually labeled to fill the remaining values of the `language` column. 1 entry has been removed because it refers to a song which was withdrawn from the competition (Serbia and Montenegro, 2006). The total number of songs in the dataset is thus 1644.
